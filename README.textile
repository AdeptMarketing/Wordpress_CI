h1. Wordpress_CI

h4. Version 0.1, February 3, 2013

This repository will allow you to place a CodeIgniter Application within a Wordpress directory and use Wordpress functions within your CodeIgniter app.Creates a new function (ci_site_url) to avoid collisions with Wordpress' site_url function and walks through how to set up Wordpress so that it doesn't mangle CodeIgniter's cookies (if sessions are used).

h2. Setup

* Add the application/helpers/MY_url_helper.php to your CodeIgniter App.
* Change all instances of site_url() in your application directory to ci_site_url; *do NOT update anything in the system directory*
** In general, updating application/views, application/controllers, application/models will do.
* If using sessions, update Wordpress per the instructions under the Sessions Section.

h2.  Sessions

Unfortunately, Wordpress loops through your $_COOKIE global and applies its "add_magic_quotes" which renders CI's COOKIE useless and one or more cookies will be created on each page load.

At this point, my solution is to edit the core file wp-includes/load.php, but there is probably a more elegant solution.

h4. In wp-includes/load.php

On about line 26, add your CI cookie to the no_unset array. I'm using the default ci_session key created by CI, but replace this with your own.

@$no_unset = array( 'GLOBALS', '_GET', '_POST', '_COOKIE', '_REQUEST', '_SERVER', '_ENV', '_FILES', 'table_prefix','ci_session' );@

To prevent Wordpress from mangling your CI cookie, scroll down to about Line 520 and add this function

@/**@
@* Applies Magic Quotes to the $_COOKIE global but ignores Codeigniter's Cookie@
@* @param  string $value Value passed by array_walk function@
@* @param  string $key   Key passed by array_walk function@
@*/@
@function ci_ignore_magic_quotes($value,$key)@
@{@
@if($key != "ci_session")@
@{@
@stripslashes_deep($value);@
@}@
@}@

Finally, comment out the following lines inside the wp_magic_quotes function and add a reference to the above ci_ignore_magic_quotes function.

@array_walk($_COOKIE, 'ci_ignore_magic_quotes');@
@//$_COOKIE = add_magic_quotes( $_COOKIE );@
